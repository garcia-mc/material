## Exploratory Data Analysis

Do an exploratory data analysis of a matrix of expression values. The data consists of expression values for samples that were treated with DMSO and TSA. The samples were measured using three technologies: bulk, IFC96, IFC800. See the two RDS files `counts.RDS` and `phenodata.RDS`



## Data Import
```{r }
x = readRDS("counts.RDS")
anno = readRDS("phenodata.RDS")
head(anno)
```

## Compute and visualize basic statistics

```{r}
n=dim(x)[2]
p=dim(x)[1]

dim(anno)
```

Columns of data matrix are samples, while each row represents the expression of the gene with the same name. Number of attributes is much bigger than sample size, possibly high dimensional issues will arise (we still do not know because we have not chosen a model yet and dimensionality refers to the proportion of involved _parameters_ (and not number of _attributes_) with respect to sample size). 

If we cross-tabulate both \verb|Treatment| and \verb|Technology| 
```{r}
xtabs(~ Treatment + Technology,anno)
```

we see that the factors are not nested (actually they are completely crossed)

How many replicates are there for each combination of factor levels? The answer to this question is in the table produced above: for example, there are 20 observations that have been treated with \verb|TSA| and measured with \verb|IFC800| technology. 

How many genes have an expression value above 0 in each sample?

```{r}
genes_nonzero=numeric(n)
for (i in 1:n) {
  genes_nonzero[i]=sum(x[,i]!=0)
  
}

genes_nonzero
which.min(genes_nonzero)
  
```
And we see that the sample which has the less genes with non-zero expression value is \verb|i=9|, 404 genes. 

## Normalize the data
Scale the columns so that the total sum of all columns are identical (in order to be able to make comparisons of gene expression between samples). 

```{r}
# we normalize such that the sum of the elements of each observation is the number of gene expressions

mean(x)
xnorm=sweep(x, 2, apply(x, 2, sum)/p, "/")

# and now we check

apply(xnorm, 2, sum)

```



## Transform the data to log-scale

Use the function `log1p` to transform the data to log-scale

```{r}
?log1p()

xlnorm=log1p(xnorm)
```




## Visualize the distribution of the expression values
Use violin plots and boxplots to visualize the distribution of the expression values
Group and color by experimental factors.

## Most variable genes

Identify the 500 most variable genes (with largest variance across samples) and continue working with those

```{r}
sort(apply(xlnorm, 1, sd), decreasing=TRUE)

# let us save the indices and subset data

ind=order(apply(xlnorm, 1, sd), decreasing=TRUE)[1:500]

xlnorm_sel=xlnorm[ind,]

dim(xlnorm_sel)


```





## Sample correlations
Compute and visualize the sample-to-sample correlations

## Clustering
Compute and visualize a hierarchical clustering of the samples, use package `hclust`

## Heatmap
Use the package `pheatmap` to generate a heatmap of the expression data.


## PCA

In the exercise session, we saw a potential case where the normal PCA can be misleading. 

```{r fig.align="center", out.width = "650px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./pca fault.png")
```

* Generate the data on the left, plot it as a scatter plot and color the points based on their class label. 
* Do the PCA, plot the variance explained by the principal components. Select $k$ such that you explain $80\%$ of the variance in your data. 
* Explain why this problem happens. 
* Try to solve the problem with your desired method and do the PCA, and plot the variance explained by your PCs. Select $k$ in order to explain $80\%$ of the variance in your data. Is the $k$ different in comparison to the previous case? 

## QUESTIONS:

- Why first normalization and then log?
- Compositional data, Aitchison geometry...
